A simple 2-player game, created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, part of Udemy Javascript course, "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!". The idea is simple. You have to type a number between 1 and 20, and see if it matches the number randomly generated by the game. You have 10 guesses. If you guess, the background color changes to green, and you can press again. You can also register a Highscore. Have fun!
