A simple 2-player game. You roll the dice and see the number on the dice's face. You can keep it and roll once more, but beware, if you roll 1, you lose all your points and your turn ends. Or, you can keep the result and end your turn. The first player to reach 20 points, or 100, depending on the difficulty level, wins the game.
